The carrer that i found most interesting was software engineering mostly because of the design and testing aspects.The skills needed are the ability to analyze technical information,analyze buisness requirements,good research and problem solving skills.The software engineers job is designing and maintaining software systems,evaluating and testing new software and optimzing software for speed and scalability.The reason this interests me is because i enjoy problem solving and desgining anything escpicially since you get the chance to design games.Also since the median pay for software engineers is $109,000 a year that means i get to enjoy my job as well as make great money.
